## Overview

### The Challenge
The challenge was to build a recipe page based on the desktop and mobile design images provided and to try and make a replica that looks as close to the original as possible.

### Screenshot
++
![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process
I started building with the html document, and added as much as I expected to add there. This included using the bold element to bold words where the font weight didn't have semantic significance, adding headers, creating lists and list items, and adding div and span elements as needed. I also added the header image and created class names for elements when I anticipated needing them. There were a few things that I would need to modify later, but this provided me with the basic structure of what I would need for the project.

I took much more time with the CSS document. Some things were quick, like altering font weight/size/color, background colors, and the header's height and width, but other parts were more challenging. In particular, adjusting margins, padding, and borders took longer, due to having to experiment to see what looked closest to the original. I had to do quite a bit of research for the table at the bottom as that wasn't something I'd done before. Adjusting the list markers to be the correct color and have the correct spacing and sizing was the most difficult, and there were some parts that I still haven't been able to achieve.

### Built with

- Visual Studio Code
- Microsoft Live Preview
- [Outfit](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Outfit) - Font 1
- [Young Serif](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Young+Serif) - Font 2

### What I learned

I learned a great deal about adjusting marker styling by utililzing a combination of CSS and html. Throughout the process, I was also able to gain insight regarding how div and span elements can be used, and I learned how to apply some of my previous CSS knowledge to create a table. It was also great practice to develop my attention to details - throughout the project, I noticed more and more minute parts of the initial design to try and replicate.

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to continue to work on my efficiency in applying the CSS and HTML tools I acquire. I'd like to streamline my process and be able to more accurately visualize project outcomes from the start.

Along with this, there were parts of this project which I did not completely succeed in. Specifically, the distance between the markers and the list item text was something that I struggled with for a long time. I was able to figure out how to fix this for the ordered list, but ran into issues utilizing the same solution for the unordered lists, and I'm still not sure why that is. I also noticed that the markers on the original are much smaller than mine. I know this could be achieved by utilizing an original image for the markers, but I don't believe that was the caase here, as there was no asset provided for the markers. Alternatively, altering the font size of the list/list items should change the size of the markers, but when I tried this, it offset the alignment with the resized text for the same list item.

### Useful resources

- [W3 Schools CSS Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/css/) - I utilized this website for reference whenever I was utilizing unfamiliar styling and to correct syntax errors.
